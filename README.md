A web-based Email spam classifier with classifies email into spam or ham as per the dataset.
• All the algorithms are selected, after the analysis of 8-10 algorithms and increased the precision of the
model by Tfid Vectorizer.
• Data cleaning,pre-processing and visualization is done, and Naive Bayes Classifier is
used as an ML model detecting whether an email is ham or spam.
• Tools & Technologies used: Python, Streamlit, NLTK,Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn
